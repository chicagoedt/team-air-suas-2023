# Object Detection Notes

## Project requirements:

- CNN model pytorch (basically yolo)
- Object detection for polygon
- Object detection for letter
- (?) color detection


## Competition requirements:

- \>= 75 feet in the air
- picture:
	- colored paper cut out from polygon
	- different colored letter or number on polygon
	- dimensions 8.5 x 11 inches
- Mannequin
	- ignore for now


## Notes:

- YOLO takes care of points 1-3?
- Shane Joy will help teach us how to use this
	- he already has letter detection that works 90%
	- will teach us how to easily use pytorch
- Ask shane about running polygon and letter detection within the same model


## Moving forward:

Deadline: February 11

1. Create testing images
1. Train PyTorch model
1. Test real-time detection "on the bench" (Feb 11)
1. Fly dummy drone with object detection over field
	- Checkerboard RC club
