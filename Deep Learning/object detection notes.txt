Project requirements:
- CNN model pytorch (basically yolo)
- object detection for polygon
- object detection for letter
- color detection ???????????????


Comp requirements:
-  >=75 feet in the air
- picture:
	- colored paper cut out from polygon
	- different colored letter or number on polygon
	- dimensions 8.5 x 11 inches
- mannequin
	- ignore for now?


Notes:
- yolo takes care of points 1-3?
- Shane joy will help teach us how to use this
	- he already has letter detection that works 90%
	- will teach us how to easily use pytorch
- ask shane about running polygon and letter detection within same model??


plan for moving forward????
- aim to get the training finalized by february 11th
1) Create testing images
2) create/ use training model for pytorch
3) Test realtime detection "on the bench" (feb 11th)
4) fly dummy drone with object detection over field
